==The One Lovers==
  * [http://theminds.googlecode.com/files/Theminds-1.1.zip 1.1: Structural mostly.] Faster quits! Faster quits between two lovers!
  * 1.2: (r88, 89) Prettier layout with padding
    ** (r86) The [Commands // command]
    ** (r75) The [Commands /query command] (try talking to yourself because it works)
    ** (r93) Kind warning if you try talking to a server window
    ** (r100) Awesome revision number
  * 1.3: (r113, r114, 115, 116, 117) Automatically seeds user list now; even more fertile code (gotta justify 4 revisions and over 200 line changes somehow, matey)
